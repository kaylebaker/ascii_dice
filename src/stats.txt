    Average Roll: Calculate and display the average value rolled across all dice rolls. This can give players an idea of the typical outcome they can expect.

    Frequency Distribution: Show the frequency of each roll value (1 to 6) across all dice rolls. This can help visualize the distribution of outcomes and identify any biases in the dice rolls.

    Standard Deviation: Calculate the standard deviation of the roll values. This measures the spread or variability of the roll outcomes, providing insights into the consistency of the dice rolls.

    Roll Sequences: Identify and display any specific roll sequences that occurred frequently or rarely. This can be interesting for analyzing patterns in the dice rolls.

    Probability of Specific Outcomes: Calculate the probability of rolling specific combinations (e.g., doubles, triples, specific sums) based on the gathered data. This can be useful for strategic gameplay or analysis.

    Luck Factor: Introduce a metric or calculation to represent the "luck factor" of each roll or player. This can be based on deviations from expected outcomes or other criteria.

    Roll Trends Over Time: If you're simulating multiple rounds or sessions, analyze and display trends in roll outcomes over time. This can include changes in average rolls, frequency distributions, etc.

    Extreme Rolls: Highlight any exceptionally high or low rolls and their frequencies. This can add excitement and curiosity to the analysis.

    Dice Pairings: If rolling multiple dice at once, analyze and display common pairings of dice values. This can be relevant for games or scenarios involving multiple dice.

    Time-Series Analysis: If applicable, analyze the dice rolls over time (if they are not all done in a single session) to identify trends or patterns based on session duration or other time-related factors.
